# Digital Electronics 2 - Project

## Description of the project

Application using an analog joy-stick (2 ADC channels, 1 push button), rotary encoder (+ push button), and Digilent PmodCLP LCD module.
We chose to implement three different features for this project : A timer, a clock and a stopwatch. The joystick will allow the user to choose between the 3 modes, and a click on the joystick push button will allow to setup the mode selected. Then, the joystick is used to select hours/minutes/seconds, and the rotary encoder is used to choose the value. A click on the rotary push button allows to reset all the values. Then, another click on the joystick push button exits the setting mode and goes back to selection. When selected, the timer and stopwatch are launched with a click on the rotary encoder push button.

## Hardware description

- The screen Digilent PmodCLP has the same interface as the Hitachi HD44780 chipset, used in the lab. Therefore, it could be connected as we did during the labs :
  - VSS : Ground
  - VDD : 5V
  - RS : PB0
  - Enalble : PB1
  - RW : Ground (always write)
  - D7:4 : PD7:4

  The definitions of pins defined in lcd_definitions.h can also be reused.

- The joystick has 2 variable tension outputs : one for the horizontal direction (x-axis) and one for the vertical direction (y-axis). They are connected to ADC Channels 0 and 1 on the micro controller (which corresponds to PC0 and PC1) The push button is used to trigger and external interrupt and is therefore connected to the external interrupt INT1 (on pin PD3).

- The rotary encoder has 2 digital outputs : CLK and DT. CLK triggers the external interrupt INT0 (on pin PD2). DT is connected to a simple GPIO (PD1). The push button is connected to PD0 and triggers the interrupt PCINT2 on pin change.

The following schematic shows the final electronic assembly:

## Software description
For this projects the next libraries were used:
* [LCD](./lib/lcd): library used for all the operations (read,write, interface settings, etc).
* [UART](./lib/uart): used for debugging.

* [GPIO](./lib/gpio): used for the Atmega328p input/output pins management.
* [Timer](./include/timer.h): used for preprocessor directives related to timers 0, 1 and 2. 
* [Adc](./include/adc.h): used for preprocessor directives related to the analog to digital internal conversor of the Atmega328p.

All the Interrupt Service Routines with their flowcharts are [here](./Documentation)
